Task Code Challenge

Before starting run `npm install` or `yarn` & `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the application

There are two `todo` items in each of: 
-- `components/TaskList.jsx`
-- `context/Task.js`
-- complete each of the todos (hint: start with the `handleChange todo`)

Style and optimize the app anywhere you see fit.

The application uses Firebase and Firestore, but that is all set up so you shouldn't need to worry about that.
